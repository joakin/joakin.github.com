Little app used for getting a random gif related to keywords.

Very useful being a remote to express yourself better in chat and emails! (and
bug trackers, etc).

Powered by the giphy api, uses react and it is full offline enabled (even
though the app is useless offline ðŸ˜…). Uses app cache and a manifest.json for
specifying it as an installable webapp.

Here is the [live demo][demo] and the [code is on github][code].
