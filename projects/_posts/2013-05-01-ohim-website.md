While freelance contracting for OHIM, we went through the creation of the **new
website** and with a team of two more front end we created implemented the **design
and layout** to the frontend using **css3**. This was a full scale redesign of all
the site using modern css techniques while maintaining **progressive enhancement
and graceful degradation**. **Responsive design techniques** were also used for best
visualization of the site on different devices.

Through the process we factored and created an internal wiki that would serve
as a **style guide** to all the new applications of OHIM and the new website, with
lots of **components**, html **live examples** on the web, and different **themes** for
a couple of areas. The styles were encapsulated on a corporate **css and js
framework** that provided styles for the applications and basic **plugins** for use
on them.

That ensured that all the applications were using the same styles consistently
and the same JS plugins and libraries when implementing interactions on more
classic web applications (not single page apps).

Obviously no examples can be shown from the style guide since it is internal
material.
