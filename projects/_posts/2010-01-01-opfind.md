A side project I did with [@joannava](https://twitter.com/joannava) for a
contest called *abredatos*, whose purpose was to create tools that exploited
public government information sources in a useful way.

It was a search engine for public servant job positions. You could subscribe to
certain search terms from RSS or email news-letter and get alerts whenever an
offer of your interest was published.

I did the design and frontend side, and Joan did the backend side.

A great hackathon (1 week) experience.
