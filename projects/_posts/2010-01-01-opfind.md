This was a project we did with [@joannava](http://twitter.com/joannava) for a
contest called abredatos, which purpose was to create tools that exploited public
government information sources in a useful way.

We did a page that scrapped the anouncements for public job positions and
indexed them, and through a search engine we offered the posibility to
subscribe to certain terms from RSS or email news-letter.

I did the layout, design and frontend side, and Joan did the backend side.

At the end just before the contest end date, our server was crashing because of
memory problems with lucene pagination, which we did incorrectly, and I guess
we could not show it.

Anyway, it was a great experience, kind of like a hackathon!
