A web application that consumed json services. It was kind of a task manager
for a specific business workflow.

It features:

* A user home page with last reviewed items and saved work lists.
* A form to create inspection requests.
  * Information loading via json services.
  * Form validation.
  * Form preview before submit.
* User created work lists.
  * Editable lists of Inspections with preview.
* Search form.
  * Basic and advanced search.
  * Results table with preview, pagination and filters.
  * Possibility to save search as Work list.
* Details of inspection.
  * Toggable animated menu.
  * Smooth scroll between sections.
  * Opening details in tabs to enable comparison of files.

I really liked how this app turned out, really smooth and with a good
consistent design.

More JS webapp experience.
