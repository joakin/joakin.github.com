Finally clojurescript can be bootstrapped, which creates a huge amount of new
possibilities for the language.

For teaching it in the workshop, I'm creating a repl where students will be
able to learn the language and load and play exercises to learn.

Very inspired by the work from @mfikes and @kanaka and standing on the
shoulders of the great clojure community.

Here is the [live demo][demo] and the [code is on github][code].
