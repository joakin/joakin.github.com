A deep long breath of fresh cold air comes through your nose, filling your
lungs, freezing you from inside. Your heart rate slows down, time stops and you
start feeling.

Feel the cold air hitting your face and hands. Each snow crop lying gentle on
the skin, the mountains and trees sitting majestic all around you.

Another big breath, feel your tired body, muscle by muscle, finally resting
after a long day surfing through the snow.

A good friend approaches with liquid gold and a smile. Take a sip of that beer
that is freezing your hand even more, and feel each drop coming in freezing the
rest of your thorax -esophagus, stomach, muscles- all your insides are cold,
relaxed.

You feel accomplished, fulfilled, happy.
