It has been a long time. In the back of my mind, I saw the time coming, but I
was getting really good money. I never asked if I really needed that money, or
if I was doing what I wanted to do. I just kept going.

With time I decided it was time to let go. Leave the job.

Long time decission

Struggle, pros and cons

Day D, the last push

Environment and unsolicited opinions

Catastrophy, crazyness, etc

Uncertanty

We are only human
