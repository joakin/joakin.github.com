Surfing through several links, first about how to configure vim to work with a
repl on clojure ([vimclojure][] || [slimev][]), then about [modern hipster
development][mhd], afterwards making some [4clojure][] problems, looking at the
docs and the repl, I've ended up on the ['Noir' site][noir].

It is a micro web framework for clojure, and just coming into the page you can
see how easy it is to grasp with some code samples (related read [Minimum
Viable Snippet - Fogus][mvs]).

I've been reading the tutorials on the site, and the docs, and I must say I
really like the information provided, and the documentation. It is really a
simple framework, with some good docs.

After reading the tutorials and giving a look to the docs, I've downloaded the 
[sample noir blog from github][noir-blog] and I've been checking the code and
it's quite nice, although very short. I wouldn't mind having a look at a more
complete application (I'll search some more).

Having spent the last ~3 years basically on frontend development has left me
with limited knowledge and almost resourceless on backend/server/computer
tools. Sure, I got a lot of knowledge on html/css and I've come to know js
deeply, but I cannot stay there only, I want to know more, I want to be full
stack. This could be the topic for a blog post, and afterwards, another topic
to write about could be how our lovely university taught us basically only
object oriented languages and paradigms.

In a certain way, I have to thank that JS has first order functions and
closures, giving me the tools to expand my horizons further than the OO
boundaries and inquiring me to relearn about programming paradigms like the
functional or the declarative one, that I once started to learn but that were
mercilessly crushed by an enormous amount of OO [patters|way of doing|coding]
through the years.
