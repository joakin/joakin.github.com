This was the first big project I started in a job on an european agency as
a contractor.

I did the frontend and also touched some spring java.

It was a search engine which searched in several sources at one time and had
2 modes, the basic one and the advanced one.

In the advanced one you could personalise the criteria of the search and form
complex queries.
Then you would get the results faceted, and clicking those facets would allow
you to filter your search.

The details page was quite complex also, it had pagination in there, and also
all sections of an entity were sortable and collapsable, and the preferences 
would stick in cookies.

This project evolved and changed into v2, which became a complete webapp
consuming json services.
