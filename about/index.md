Hi! I'm Joaquin.

I'm a programmer from Alicante, Spain.

If you want to get in touch with me, try [email](mailto://joaquin@chimeces.com)
first, or any of the sites on the side bar.

You can check what I write about on the [blog](/blog) and some of the stuff
I've worked on the [projects page](/projects).

I mainly specialize on **front end development**. I also consider myself quite
capable in the following areas (ordered from better to worse):

  * Ui development
  * Web design
  * Backend coding
  * System administration

I like coding, and learning about new topics and ways of doing things. I hate
repetitive tasks, the perfect environment is one where you would never make the
same stuff twice.

I feel attracted to all kind of art forms (but I don't really practice any of
em). I like reading, writing, drawing and music. I like cinema, performances,
and artsy videos.

Also, I feel huge entrepreneurial impulses, not yet fulfilled in any real way.
