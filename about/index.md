Hi! I'm Joaquin.

I'm a programmer from Alicante, Spain.

Currently I am working remotely in open source for the Wikimedia Foundation,
improving the mobile web version of Wikimedia projects.

If you want to get in touch with me, try [email](mailto://joaquin@chimeces.com)
first, or any of the sites on the links list.

You can check what I write about on the [blog](/blog), and some of side
projects and work I've done on the [projects page](/projects).

I've been working with **javascript** for about 7 years, most of it doing
**front end development**. Most of the last 5 years I've been writing *native
web applications*. I also enjoy doing:

  * UI development
    * Creating well architected, useful and clean interfaces and interactions
      is very rewarding and something I love
  * Web design
    * I am not a designer, but enjoy prototyping interfaces and designs, and
      have good taste doing so
  * Backend coding
    * I've done a lot of node.js and some Clojure and I've had a great time
      with it
  * System administration
    * Because of side projects mainly I've dabbled into setting up virtual
      machines, provisioning with shell scripts and ansible, fast & easy
      continuous deployment via git, and a variety of skills on that matter,
      which have proven very useful bringing projects to life

Programming is one of my hobbies, and also my job.

I love travelling, biking and nature.
