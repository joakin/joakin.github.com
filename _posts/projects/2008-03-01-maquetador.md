I did this project when I was working for the university before finishing my
degree.

It was a web application that would be used to layout pages and generate pdf
magazines.

In the frontend it was a full javascript application, my first one. This was
before the days of backbone and other frontend frameworks.

It was written in pure javascript with jQuery and jQuery UI to support.

The design in general was quite poor but it was full of nice functionality.

Auto generated index, templates for the magazine, templates for headers,
predefined layouts, freedom to add boxes and images, etc.

It was also possible to save and load the work done, and afterwards you could
download the pdf resulting from your work.

The articles and images could be written and edited in place or taken from
certain databases. In the backend with j2ee I did as proxy and consulted the
data sources.

For the pdf generation I used a firefox on the server, and some scripts, where
it would load the same work locally, print it to pdf, and then return it to the
client.

The result was quite clumsy in terms of memory management but it was pretty
powerful in terms of layouts, css and pdf printing.

By the time there was not any headless browser that I knew or could use...

Anyway, this was a nice project, where I learnt a lot of Javascript.
