This was a prototype for an application that had to be rewritten. It is/was
a fully functional web application that consumed json services.

It features:

* A user home page with last reviewed items and saved work lists
* A form to create inspection requests
  * Information loading via services
  * Form validation
  * Form preview before submit
* User created work lists
  * Editable lists of Inspections with preview
* Search form
  * Basic and advanced search
  * Results table with preview, pagination and filters
  * Posibility to save search as Work list
* Details of inspection
  * Hideable menu
  * Smooth scroll between sections
  * Details open in a tab to enable comparison and such

From the previous project and this one I started truly learning javascript and
getting a good level on it.

I really liked how this prototype turned out, really smooth and with a good
consistent design.

Anyway, it was not used for anything...
