This was the last project that I worked on as 23pixeles. I did a full website
powered by drupal as a CMS for a 'online' shop for a couple of story tellers.

They had very original stories/tales that they composed mixing poetry, kid
drawings and the photos of the main characters on the books.

It was a full experience, from design, and business talk, to front end and
backend work (and sysadm :) )

ps: I'm sorry about the js animations, they made me do it, so do not blame me
if your cpu goes up to the roof (animated gifs js moved)
