I was on Germany in a Erasmus scholarship on my 4th year at college, when
I decided that I wanted to learn Ruby on Rails.

At that time I watched lots of tv shows, and I had some trouble keeping up with
what had I seen and what not.

So I made a web app to keep the shows that I watched with the last chapter saved.
It would tell the user when the shows had new chapters, and let him add new
shows to follow, etc.

After I finished it, I spent 9 months using it for personal use. Suddenly the web page where
I scrapped the chapters information and links realised that somebody was
scrapping them and cut my IP off.

The reality is that I did the scrapping irrespectfully but also unknowing that
I was kind of screwing them.

They threatened to sue me if I would not stop, and almost did not listen to me,
so at the end I had to shut it down even though I fixed the issues and make the
scrapping respectful.

The version visible at the screenshots is the v2, which I was planning to
apply to v1 shortly before they sued me. It never happened.

This has kind of been my go-to idea when I need to test a new technology or
learn something new. 

It provides me scaffold objectives, displaying and updating data, search
capabilities, cron jobs and scripting and scrapping. 
Pretty complete for a test project.

This was my first loner project, and I am really fond of it, still today.
