Oldie stuff also.

At 5rd grade in college, a friend was doing his final project about natural
language algorithms.

He was doing a web page but had no design skills, so he asked me the favor.

I did the web design, he was pleased, and got good grades at the end.

Too many shadows here... :D Looks like I just discovered them.

Oh and the name... 

* He did not have one for his project
* He was being mentored by the database teacher
* I hated databases

So at the end I chose this one for the mockups, but later he changed it before
delivery.
