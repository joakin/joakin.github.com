5th year at college. Summer.

A friend and I meet at the swimming pool and start planning an enterprise to
create customer sites.

After a long time we come up with 23pixeles, clearly a copy of 37signals.

We created the page, we started looking for opportunities.

We learned a lot. The bargaining and being cheap of the begining. Going to meetings
and talking to clients, working on deadlines, etc.

Some products were created, we earned little money and were cheated and
mistreated... 

At the end, I can probably say that it was worth it, since
I learn a lot about real life business.

One year later my friend started a consulting job for the man, and started
ignoring the stuff. I did one more project alone and finally he moved to Madrid
to work for a bigger man. So ends the story.

We even had business cards :)
