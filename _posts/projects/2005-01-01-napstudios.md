Oldie stuff.

At 3rd grade in college, a friend and I decided to create a company to start
making websites.

We thought long about the name, one night with lots of beer and free time.

At the end we came with Nap studios, and I designed a logo with a bear taking
a nap on a tree.

We made the "*beautiful*" website, and even uploaded it to the internet, but
studies, exams, etc. made it go nowhere.

Hell, it even had 2 languages! Good stuff
