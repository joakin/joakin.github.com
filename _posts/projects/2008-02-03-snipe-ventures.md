This was one of the projects ordered to 23pixeles, with promises and lies.

Meetings, buzzwords and such.

After the design phases, and a couple of meetings and deliverables, we created the 
site.

Then we asked for the money in advanced before delivering, and nothing was given,
everything finished.

Promises vanished, money never appeared, and luckily he only had the designs,
but not the website.
