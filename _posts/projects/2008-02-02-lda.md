This was our first big project within 23pixeles.

For no money -great price we got- we would be able to create a full page for
a music band that had neither popularity nor income.

This pop band with great aspirations was a mix between an NGO and a band, and
it had both of them together, so by base they would give 30% of their income to
certain associations and NGOs.

Anyway, we did the whole page, with suffering and effort, and got paid nothing.
Just a spot in our portfolio.

There was a heavy design phase, we did logo design, photograpy work, web
design, even shirt and other stuff design. Nothing was paid.

We learnt a lot in this project. You always need to know your clients if you
have them, and learn to treat them. And always value yourself.

The thing is, if you think you should do a free web page to have something in
your portfolio, then do it with your imaginary business and your imaginary
client. And do it several times.

It is faster, better, to work against your own specifications than to the ones
of a real client. 

If the objective is to fill up work for free, fastly, then do it for yourself and 
not for a person that will slow you down.

Anyway, we were quite happy with the result after all the effort. 

After some time, they wanted free fixes -which we could not provide, no time-
and also a re-design.

In the end nothing happened and they changed their website to an autogenerated
one, with no design, no cms, etc. Good sign!
